A plugin used to set radius for skip hire, process booking, and take payments.

## Outdated

This plugin is no longer under active development. A new version has been created and updated using the Plugin framework under Adtrak.

## Description

This plugin will make it easy for a skip hire form to be added to a site. It will look up on your post code and if you are within a radius then you will be able to higher a skip. This will lead you to process the information required, permit and then finally pay via phone or paypal.
