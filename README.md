A plugin used to set radius for skip hire, process booking, and take payments.

## Description

This plugin will make it easy for a skip hire form to be added to a site. It will look up on your post code and if you are within a radius then you will be able to higher a skip. This will lead you to process the information required, permit and then finally pay via phone or paypal.

## Documentation

Coming soon. WIP

### Shortcodes

so there are shortcodes in, but the plugin will automatically create them, however you can add them manually just in case something goes wrong.

#### Post Code Form

we can use the postcode form anywhere on the site as it will allow us to display a short form, leading into the larger form. (Pulls lat/lng)

> [ash_postcode_form]

####Â Booking Form

these are automatically added and will generate all the necessary code on their pages. in case anything happens you can add them to ensure proper results

> [ash_booking_form]

> [ash_booking_confirmation]
